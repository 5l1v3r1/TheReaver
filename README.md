# TheReaver
Open Source Tool for automate WPS pin attacks based on a local database and/or 3wifi.stascorp.com offline method (Javascript known algorithms pin generator)


# How It Works? 3wifi.stascorp.com Method

In this git you can find an offline version of 3wifi.stascorp.com.
It's a page based on html + javascript that calculate all possible PINS by typing your BSSID.
To execute it you have just to open index.html (TheReaver/3WIFI: WPS PIN generator_files) in a browser.

As you can see you will get all WPS PIN possible for your router calculated with solid alghoritms in javascript by the page.
After that you can save the results in a txt, then you have to indicate the path to TheReaver Program when it asks "Insert Pin File (DEFAULT Pins in db):".

Program will automatically format the input and will begin to try all PINS and if attack ends succesfully you will get all infos about the attack with the password in clear format!

# Default WPS PINS of router with local database based on airgeddon
To proceed with this method you have to leave blank the previous question => "Insert Pin File (DEFAULT Pins in db):".
Warning! Try this at last chance Because Default Router's PIN are few and the attack could fail.
